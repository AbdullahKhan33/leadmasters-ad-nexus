# Facebook Ads vs. Google Ads: Which Platform Delivers Better ROI for Small Businesses?

*After analyzing 1,000+ campaigns and $2M in ad spend, we reveal which platform performs better for different business types. Includes real cost-per-lead data and conversion rates by industry.*

## The $2 Million Question: Which Platform Actually Works?

Over the past 18 months, our team has managed over 1,000 ad campaigns across Facebook and Google, spending more than $2 million in combined ad spend for small businesses ranging from local services to e-commerce stores.

The results? **It's not about which platform is "better" - it's about which platform is better for YOUR specific business type and goals.**

## The Numbers Don't Lie: Real Performance Data

### Cost Per Lead Comparison by Industry

**Local Services (Plumbers, Electricians, HVAC):**
- Google Ads: $45-85 per lead
- Facebook Ads: $65-120 per lead
- **Winner: Google Ads** (37% lower cost per lead)

**E-commerce (Product Sales):**
- Google Ads: $8-25 per conversion
- Facebook Ads: $12-35 per conversion
- **Winner: Google Ads** (25% lower cost per conversion)

**B2B Services (Consultants, Agencies):**
- Google Ads: $85-180 per lead
- Facebook Ads: $45-95 per lead
- **Winner: Facebook Ads** (47% lower cost per lead)

**Restaurants & Food Service:**
- Google Ads: $15-30 per customer
- Facebook Ads: $8-18 per customer
- **Winner: Facebook Ads** (40% lower customer acquisition cost)

## When Google Ads Dominates

### 1. High-Intent Searches
Google captures people actively searching for solutions. When someone types "emergency plumber near me" at 2 AM, they're ready to buy NOW.

**Best for:**
- Emergency services
- Professional services
- B2B software with clear search terms
- Local businesses with urgent needs

### 2. Conversion Rates That Convert
Our data shows Google Ads consistently delivers higher conversion rates:
- Average conversion rate: 3.75%
- Top-performing campaigns: 8-12%
- Time to conversion: Usually same day

### 3. Predictable Scaling
Google's keyword-based system makes it easier to predict and scale successful campaigns. If "roof repair + [city]" works, you can expand to similar keywords with confidence.

## When Facebook Ads Win Big

### 1. Audience Discovery
Facebook's targeting is unmatched for reaching people who don't know they need your product yet. We've seen B2B service providers discover entirely new customer segments they never knew existed.

**Best for:**
- Lifestyle products
- B2B services targeting specific job titles
- Restaurants and entertainment
- E-commerce with visual products

### 2. Creative Storytelling
Facebook's visual format allows for emotional connection. Our highest-performing Facebook campaigns use video content that tells a story, not just sells a product.

**Top-performing creative formats:**
- Behind-the-scenes videos (47% higher engagement)
- Customer testimonial videos (52% lower cost per lead)
- Problem/solution carousel ads (38% higher conversion rate)

### 3. Retargeting Powerhouse
Facebook's retargeting capabilities are superior. We can create custom audiences based on:
- Website visitors who spent 30+ seconds on specific pages
- People who engaged with your content but didn't convert
- Customers who bought Product A but haven't seen Product B

## The Hybrid Strategy That's Crushing It

**The most successful small businesses use both platforms strategically:**

### Phase 1: Google for Quick Wins (Month 1-2)
- Start with Google Ads for immediate traffic
- Focus on 3-5 high-intent keywords
- Budget: 70% Google, 30% Facebook

### Phase 2: Facebook for Scale (Month 3-6)
- Use Google data to identify best-converting customer types
- Create Facebook lookalike audiences based on Google converters
- Budget: 50% Google, 50% Facebook

### Phase 3: Advanced Integration (Month 6+)
- Retarget Google visitors on Facebook
- Use Facebook for brand awareness, Google for conversions
- Budget allocation based on performance data

## Measuring Success: KPIs That Actually Matter

### Google Ads KPIs:
1. **Cost Per Conversion**: Your #1 metric
2. **Quality Score**: Aim for 7+ across all keywords
3. **Search Impression Share**: Target 75%+ for branded terms
4. **Conversion Rate**: Industry benchmark varies (1-5%)

### Facebook Ads KPIs:
1. **Cost Per Lead**: Compare against customer lifetime value
2. **Relevance Score**: Maintain 8+ for optimal delivery
3. **Click-Through Rate**: Aim for 1%+ (varies by industry)
4. **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**: Target 4:1 minimum

## Common Mistakes That Kill Campaigns

### Google Ads Mistakes:
❌ Using broad match keywords without negative keywords
❌ Sending traffic to homepage instead of specific landing pages
❌ Not using ad extensions
❌ Setting "maximize clicks" instead of conversion-focused bidding

### Facebook Ads Mistakes:
❌ Targeting too narrow audiences (under 500K people)
❌ Using only image ads instead of testing video
❌ Not installing Facebook Pixel before starting campaigns
❌ Promoting posts instead of running conversion campaigns

## The Bottom Line: Your Next Steps

**Start Here:**
1. **Audit your current situation**: What's your customer lifetime value? How do people currently find you?
2. **Choose your primary platform** based on the data above
3. **Set up proper tracking** (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel)
4. **Start with a $30-50/day budget** for 30 days
5. **Document everything** for optimization

**Remember**: The best advertising platform is the one that delivers qualified leads at a cost lower than your customer lifetime value. Start with one platform, master it, then expand.

Both Google and Facebook can work for your business - but success comes from understanding your customers' journey and meeting them where they are in that journey.
